{-
The name of this module is very slightly misleading - on top of just asserting correct parses, it
also checks that calling 'resolve' on the parsed output is a NOP and that re-parsing the printed
output is the same. This doesn't fully check that 'resolve' works - but it does provide some checks
that it isn't grossly broken. Plus it adds some more pretty printing checks!
