# Proofs

Warning: The proofs in here are outdated, they do not seem to compile at present
due to newer libraries / dependencies, and the semantics as implemented in Coq
in this directory likely have a semantic bug: one which does not meaningfully
affect the correctness of the size_correctness proof defined herein. To
view the updated semantics look at `app/semantics.hs` in the root of this
repository, or checkout the [preprint](https://cronburg.com/papers/floorplan19.pdf)
of the associated paper.
